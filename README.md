# ECE357-Operating-System

Coursework at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.

---
The coursework was divided into seven problem sets, each about 250 lines long. We firstly implemented multiple customized commands in Unix-like operating systems in C, including cat, find, and piping. Then, we moved into more advanced topics like synchronization & locking, virtual memory & memory management, and assembly language. This course developed my practical skills at programming through basic error handling paradigms, case studies and the design process of a real-time, fault-tolerant and high security operating system.
